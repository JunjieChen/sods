There are five folders: implementation details, mutants, results, source, test cases. We describe each folder as follows.

implementation details:
    In this folder, there is a file named details.txt, in which we explained many implementation details of our static approach.
	  
mutants:
    In this folder, there are also eleven folders, each of which represents that we used mutants during our experimental study for corresponding subject.
	In particular, "mutants.log" is the log of all the mutants generated by the mutation tool. 
	"used_mutants.txt" lists the serial number that we used mutants, which corresponds to the log file "mutants.log".
	
results:
    In this folder, there are also eleven folders, each of which contains our raw experimental results for each subject.

test cases:
    This folder contains the test cases that we used for each subject.
	

Thanks.
